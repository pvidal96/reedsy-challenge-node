# Node.js Fullstack Engineer Challenge

## 1. About you

Since I wasn't involved in a project with both, I'll tell you about two different projects:

- In Addmin (a Swiss startup) I worked with Node (and React) to develop a modern document automation platform (mobile app and web app). This app should either handle fiduciary tasks for companies like batch OCR recognition and classification of documents, or everyday tasks for users to securely store their taxes, contracts, etc. and get reminders about due dates or perform automations.
  As one of the original developers, I was involved in developing most of the features of the application. The backend consisted of an API to serve the frontend, another API designed for clients (companies) and several microservices like authentication, OCR, document export and PDF tools.
- At Inbenta (my last company), I was part of the chatbot team and we were responsible for maintaining and developing this product that can be implemented by companies (i.e. a bank that wants a chatbot to help users with simple procedures or just provide help).
  We mainly used PHP + Vue 2. Since it is a large company with many different products, we shared (and maintained) several common Vue.js component libraries to have the same styling and look in each product. The products offered to the client were highly customizable, so any change had to be handled carefully to fit each client's needs and current implementation. The CMS had a lot of functionality, but it's looks were a bit outdated, so we did several major updates involving the main looks like the dashboards to display information in a nicer, friendlier way.
